    <h3>Bread and Butter Pizza</h3>
    <p>Bread and Butter Pizza uses slices of several-day-old bread (rather than uncooked dough) to create a uniquely crunchy crust. Typically, this method results in a sad excuse for a pizza slice, but this hack ensures you get a crave-worthy dish every time.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Thick slices of bread</li>
        <li>Parmaesan Cheese</li>
        <li>Your favorite Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>Pepperoni</li>
        <li>Mozzarella</li>
        <li>Prebaked tomato-sauced slices</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start with a simple baking hack for keeping parchment in place: Just make a few small dots of butter directly on the baking pan to help the paper stick. Parchment will give you the crispiest texture, although aluminum foil would work just fine as well.</li>
        <li>Place six thick slices of bread on the baking pan, separating each piece a few inches apart. The next step (and the dish’s namesake) is to generously butter both sides of each slice. Grate a block of fresh Parmesan cheese over the top—not enough to pile up, but enough to cover the bread from crust to crust.</li>
        <li>After each slice is coated, gently press the cheese down to secure it, then flip the bread cheese side down. The cheese and butter will meld together and caramelize onto the bottom of the pan. With the cheese side down, spoon your favorite pizza sauce onto the opposite buttered side, smoothing it from edge to edge. Don’t be too heavy-handed—a little will go a long way.</li>
        <li>Here’s a secret, essential step: before adding on the cheese topping, you’ll prebake the tomato-sauced slices. This will cause the sauce on top to caramelize slightly.</li>
        <li>Finally, load up each slice as you would a regular pizza crust, with fresh mozzarella (Chef John prefers to dice it first), a few slices of pepperoni, and your other favorite toppings. Bake until browned and melty, then move to a cooling rack so the bottom crust doesn’t get steamy in the pan. Finally, enjoy your hot, extra-crispy piece of buttery pizza.</li>
